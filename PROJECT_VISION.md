# PROJECT VISION - Single Manuscript AI Revision System

## üéØ SINGLE OVERRIDING GOAL

**Transform ONE specific, professionally-edited manuscript into its optimal form for agent submission by using AI to analyze and guide strategic chapter reordering, especially for starting in medias res.**

This is a SINGLE-USE, BESPOKE application for ONE AUTHOR, ONE MANUSCRIPT, ONE SUBMISSION CYCLE.

---

## üìñ THE MANUSCRIPT

- **Status**: Professionally edited, well-written prose
- **Need**: Strategic restructuring for maximum market impact
- **Key Strategy**: Potentially start in medias res (high action scene)
- **Challenge**: Maintaining narrative coherence after any reordering

---

## üöÄ CORE FUNCTIONALITY NEEDED

### 1. Manuscript Ingestion & AI Knowledge
**Purpose**: Make AI intimately familiar with entire manuscript

**Implementation**:
```
- Load complete manuscript (all chapters with full text)
- Create chapter summaries and dependency maps
- Build knowledge base for AI to reference
- Store character arcs, plot points, reveals
- Track tension levels per chapter
```

**Success Metric**: AI can answer "What happens in Chapter 17?" or "When is Sarah's betrayal revealed?" or "Which chapters have the highest action?"

### 2. Strategic Opening Analysis
**Purpose**: AI helps identify optimal opening chapter

**Key Questions AI Must Answer**:
- "Which chapters would make compelling openings?"
- "What's the tension/action level of each chapter?"
- "Which chapters could work as standalone hooks?"
- "What are the trade-offs of starting with each?"

**AI Analysis Output**:
```markdown
Potential Opening Chapters Ranked:

1. Chapter 23 (Action: 9/10, Hook: 10/10)
   - Pros: Immediate tension, vivid scene
   - Cons: Requires context about the virus
   - Changes needed: 14 specific edits

2. Chapter 15 (Action: 8/10, Hook: 8/10)  
   - Pros: Character conflict, lower context needs
   - Cons: Reveals relationship dynamics early
   - Changes needed: 7 specific edits

3. Chapter 1 (Current) (Action: 3/10, Hook: 5/10)
   - Pros: No changes needed, sets up world
   - Cons: Slow burn, may lose impatient readers
```

### 3. Intelligent Reordering Analysis
**Purpose**: AI identifies all impacts of any chapter reordering

**For ANY Reordering Decision**:
- "If I start with Chapter [X], what context is missing?"
- "What spoilers does Chapter [X] contain?"
- "Which chapters need modification?"
- "What should become flashbacks vs linear narrative?"
- "How does this affect story arc and tension curve?"

**Implementation**:
```
- Test multiple opening scenarios
- Analyze ripple effects through manuscript
- Identify specific line/paragraph changes
- Suggest flashback placement
- Recommend transition strategies
```

### 4. Revision Guidance System
**Purpose**: Specific, actionable revision instructions

**AI Outputs**:
- Line-by-line changes needed in affected chapters
- New transition paragraphs to write
- Specific sentences that spoil unrevealed information
- Recommended flashback insertion points
- Timeline consistency issues
- POV adjustments needed

**Format**: 
```markdown
Starting with Chapter [X] - Required Changes:

Chapter X Modifications:
- Line 47: References "the virus" - reader doesn't know about this yet
  SOLUTION: Change to "the mysterious outbreak" 
- Line 132: Mentions Sarah's betrayal - happens in Chapter 15
  SOLUTION: Cut this line, make it internal tension instead
- Missing Context: Reader needs to know about Marcus's expertise
  SOLUTION: Add 2-paragraph flashback after line 78

Ripple Effects:
- Chapter 3: Remove callback to opening scene
- Chapter 7: Adjust timeline reference
- Chapter 12: Change "as mentioned" to full explanation
```

### 5. Version Control System (Simplified)
**Purpose**: Save and compare different reordering experiments

**Features**:
```typescript
interface Version {
  id: string
  name: string  // "Original", "Start Ch23", "Start Ch15 + Flashbacks"
  description: string
  chapterOrder: number[]
  modifications: Map<chapterId, TextChanges>
  created: Date
  aiAnalysis: AnalysisResult
  isBaseVersion: boolean  // Can stamp as new baseline
}
```

**Capabilities**:
- Save current state as version
- Compare any two versions
- Stamp version as new baseline
- Revert to any saved version
- See AI analysis for each version

**What This is NOT**:
- Not Git-level complexity
- Not branching/merging
- Just snapshots of different arrangements

## üõ†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Manuscript Knowledge Base (Week 1)
```typescript
// 1. Create manuscript data structure
interface ManuscriptKnowledge {
  chapters: Array<{
    number: number
    title: string

interface OpeningCriteria {
  maximizeAction: boolean
  minimizeRevisions: boolean
  preserveChronology: boolean
  marketAppeal: 'literary' | 'commercial' | 'genre'
}
```

### Phase 3: Revision Workflow with Versions (Week 3)
```typescript
// 1. Create version for each experiment
async function createVersion(
  name: string,
  chapterOrder: number[],
  analysis: AIAnalysis
): Promise<Version>

// 2. Apply and track modifications
interface RevisionTask {
  versionId: string
  chapter: number
  location: LineRange
  issue: string
  suggestion: string
  priority: 'critical' | 'important' | 'minor'
  completed: boolean
}

// 3. Compare versions
async function compareVersions(
  versionA: string,
  versionB: string
): Promise<VersionComparison>

// 4. Stamp as new baseline
async function setBaselineVersion(
  versionId: string
): Promise<void>
```

### Phase 4: Validation & Export (Week 4)
```typescript
// 1. Final coherence check for selected version
async function validateVersion(
  versionId: string
): Promise<ValidationReport>

// 2. Export in submission format
async function exportForSubmission(
  versionId: string
): Promise<SubmissionPackage>
```

## ‚ö° QUICK WINS PATH

### Day 1-2: Get AI Working
```javascript
// Find best opening chapters
async function findOpenings() {
  const chapters = loadAllChapters()
  const analyses = []
  
  for (const chapter of chapters) {
    const analysis = await claude.complete(`
      Analyze this chapter as a potential novel opening:
      ${chapter.text}
      
      Rate 1-10: action, hook strength, standalone clarity
      List: required context, spoilers contained
    `)
    analyses.push(analysis)
  }
  
  return rankByOpeningPotential(analyses)
}
```

### Day 3-4: Test Arrangements
```javascript
// Test specific reordering
async function testReorder(startChapter) {
  const manuscript = loadManuscript()
  
  const prompt = `
    I want to start my novel with Chapter ${startChapter}.
    Current order: ${manuscript.chapterOrder}
    
    Chapter ${startChapter} text: ${manuscript.chapters[startChapter]}
    Other chapter summaries: ${manuscript.summaries}
    
    What specific changes are needed?
  `
  
  return await claude.complete(prompt)
}
```

### Day 5-6: Simple Versions
```javascript
// Save arrangement as version
function saveVersion(name, order, changes) {
  const version = {
    id: Date.now(),
    name,
    chapterOrder: order,
    modifications: changes,
    created: new Date()
  }
  
  versions.push(version)
  if (setAsBaseline) currentVersion = version.id
}
```

### Day 7: Export & Compare
- Compare 2-3 best arrangements
- Choose optimal version
- Export submission-ready manuscript

---

## üö® REMEMBER

**This is for ONE manuscript, for ONE submission cycle.**

Every feature decision should answer: "Does this help me find and implement the optimal chapter arrangement?"

If the answer is no, DON'T BUILD IT.

Version control should be SIMPLE - just saving snapshots of different arrangements, not complex branching.

## üéØ NORTH STAR

When complete, you should be able to say:

> "The AI analyzed my entire manuscript and showed me that Chapters 15, 23, and 31 would make the strongest openings. I tested all three arrangements, saved each as a version, and could see exactly what changes each required. I chose Chapter 15, applied the AI's specific revision suggestions, and now my manuscript opens with compelling action while maintaining perfect narrative coherence. I can switch between my versions to compare them or continue refining."

**THAT'S THE MISSION. STRATEGIC REORDERING WITH AI GUIDANCE.**
